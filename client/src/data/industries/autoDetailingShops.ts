  // Industry Overview
  industryOverview: {
    title: "The Auto Detailing Market Opportunity",
    paragraphs: [
      "The auto detailing industry is experiencing significant growth as car owners increasingly value professional detailing services, paint protection, and vehicle maintenance. Premium services like ceramic coating, paint correction, and interior restoration command $500-$3,000+ per job, representing substantial revenue opportunities for detailing shops that can attract the right customers. However, the market is also highly competitive and fragmented, with hundreds of mobile detailers and small shops competing for the same local customers.",
      "The biggest challenge facing detailing shops is differentiation and visibility. Most potential customers searching for 'car detailing near me' or 'ceramic coating [city]' never see your business because you don't rank in local search results. They default to choosing competitors based on whoever appears first in Google or has the most reviews, regardless of actual service quality. This commoditization forces many detailers to compete on price rather than quality, leading to lower margins and inconsistent bookings.",
      "Digital marketing for detailing shops requires a strategic approach focused on visual storytelling, service education, and premium positioning. By ranking #1 in local search, maintaining a 4.5+ star rating with stunning before/after photos, and running targeted advertising for premium services, you can attract customers who value quality over price. This allows you to command premium pricing, maintain consistent bookings, and build a loyal customer base that returns for regular maintenance."

  faqs: [
    {
      question: "How do you help detailing shops attract premium customers instead of price shoppers?",
      answer: "We target keywords like 'ceramic coating,' 'paint correction,' and 'luxury car detailing' that attract customers willing to pay for quality. We also help you showcase your best work with professional before/after photos and educate customers about premium services through strategic content."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help with both mobile detailing and shop-based services?",
      answer: "Yes! We optimize for both 'mobile detailing [city]' and shop-based searches. We can also help you create separate service pages for mobile vs. shop services with appropriate pricing and service descriptions for each."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see more bookings?",
      answer: "Most detailing shops see increased booking requests within 30 days from Google Ads. SEO results typically take 60-90 days as we build your rankings and authority. The key is consistency—shops that stick with us for 6+ months see the most dramatic growth in premium service bookings."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you help with online booking integration?",
