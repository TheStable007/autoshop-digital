  // Industry Overview
  industryOverview: {
    title: "The SMOG Check Market Opportunity",
    paragraphs: [
      "The SMOG check and emissions testing industry represents a unique business model with both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, SMOG tests are mandatory in many states, creating guaranteed demand from millions of vehicle owners who need biennial testing. On the other hand, the service is highly commoditized with thin margins, intense price competition, and seasonal demand fluctuations that create cash flow challenges. Success in this industry requires maximizing test volume, capturing repair revenue from failed tests, and marketing additional services beyond basic SMOG checks.",
      "The biggest challenge facing SMOG stations is visibility and differentiation. Most potential customers searching for 'SMOG check near me' or 'emissions test [city]' never see your station because you don't rank in local search results. They default to choosing whoever appears first in Google or has the most convenient location, regardless of service quality or additional offerings. This commoditization forces many stations to compete solely on price, leading to razor-thin margins and difficulty covering fixed costs during slow months.",
      "Digital marketing for SMOG stations requires a strategic approach focused on local search dominance, convenience messaging, and multi-service positioning. By ranking #1 in local search for your service area, maintaining a 4.5+ star rating, and running targeted advertising during peak registration months, you can maximize test volume and station utilization. Additionally, marketing your repair capabilities and additional services allows you to capture high-margin repair revenue from failed tests and increase average customer value beyond the basic SMOG check fee."
